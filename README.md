# PDF Viewer for VS Code

A lightweight Visual Studio Code extension that lets you view PDF files directly inside the editor.

## Features

- **In-editor PDF rendering** — open any `.pdf` file and it displays in a VS Code tab using [PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/).
- **Page navigation** — move between pages with previous/next controls.
- **Zoom controls** — zoom in, zoom out, and fit-to-width.
- **Retained context** — the webview keeps its state when switching between tabs.

## Getting Started

1. Install the extension.
2. Open any `.pdf` file in VS Code — it will automatically render in the PDF Viewer.

## Requirements

- VS Code **1.109.0** or later.

## Extension Settings

This extension does not add any configurable settings.

## Known Issues

None at this time.
